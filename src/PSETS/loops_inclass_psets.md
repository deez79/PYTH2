### p1.py Odds & Evens

```python
"""
Odds & Evens
"""

# Use a loop to make a list of all odd numbers between 1 and 10 and another list with all the evens. When done, print the lists.

# odds =

### p2.py Lists with Duplicates

```python
"""
Lists with Duplicates

# First, print list a below as it is now.

a = [2, 4, 10, 20, 5, 2, 20, 4]

# Using a loop, remove the duplicate items from list a and print out the updated list.


# Using a loop, merge list b into list a without adding any duplicates.

### p3.py Temperature Conversions

```python

sampleF = [71.6, 82.4, 91.4, 107.6, 125.6]

# Convert each item in this list into degrees Celsius and add the results to a dict called sample_temps so that the conversion of each day's temperature is easily accessible. For reference, the conversion equation between F and C is:
# Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0/9.0

### p4.py Factorials

```python
"""
Factorials
"""

### p6.py Greatest Common Denominator (GCD)


```python
