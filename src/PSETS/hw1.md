# Rewrite p1, but this time use the input() command to solicit user input for name, price, quantity. Here's how it works:

# use input() function and ask user to name items
item_name_1 = None
item_name_2 = None
item_name_3 = None

# use input() function and ask user to name prices

# JUST REMEMBER: now this will be defined by the user!!
