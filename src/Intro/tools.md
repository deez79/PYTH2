# Tools and Resources

Please find below important tools and resources that would be useful for class.

## ðŸŽ‰ [Introductory Slides](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/rehearsal/public/stage.html?source=o66ry#/)

This will be one of the only two slide decks we ever get through in class. Use this resource to set expectations about class in general on a high level.

## ðŸŽˆ[Live Class Notes](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/autosync/#/course/pydev/0)

Live class notes! Anything I write in my code editor will be beamed here for your convenience!

## ðŸŽŠ [Slack](https://pythondevelop-djt5888.slack.com/)

Class slack! This is how we communicate and keep in touch.
