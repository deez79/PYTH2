# Tools and Resources

Please find below important tools and resources that would be useful for class.

## ðŸŽ‰ [Introductory Slides](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/rehearsal/public/stage.html?source=o66ry#/)

This will be one of the only two slide decks we ever get through in class. Use this resource to set expectations about class in general on a high level.

## ðŸŽŠ [Slack](https://pythondevelop-djt5888.slack.com/)

Class slack! This is how we communicate and keep in touch.

## [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

Jupyter Notebooks is an open source web application that allows us to run "live" python code in "code" blocks and add explanatory text around it, describing the code and our methods.

In data science, this is of paramount importance because we are using code to tell a story - one that interprets a set of data and offers insight and/or conclusions.

## [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)

You can install Jupyter Notebooks locally, BUT instead we will leverage a Google project called **Colaboratory**, or **Colab** for short.

Open the link above and sign in to your Google account. Together in class, we'll explore what a notebook can do!


## ðŸŽˆ[Live Class Notes](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/autosync/#/course/pydev/0)

Live class notes! Anything I write in my code editor will be beamed here for your convenience!
